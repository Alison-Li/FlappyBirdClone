# Flappy Bird Clone

Created using Thomas Palef's tutorial on [How to Make Flappy Bird in HTML5 with Phaser](http://www.lessmilk.com/tutorial/flappy-bird-phaser-1). The default assets feature a special appearance from @Jongwoo-Shim as the bird and his aversion to cats as the obstacles. Thanks to @morrisaurus-rex for adding the feature of being able to upload your own bird and obstacles!
